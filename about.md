I am currently a software engineer at [Jump Trading](http://jumptrading.com), living in Chicago.

My interests include programming language theory and design, compilers, operating systems, and high performance computing.

I have managed to earn a Computer Science University of Illinois, with a minor in Math.
Check out my [undergraduate senior thesis](http://dpzmick.com/ugrad-thesis/paper.pdf).

My favorite food is probably Iranian/Persian food (at least that's what my favorite restaurant says it is).
I like to play drums and am toying with piano.
According to most of my friends, my music taste is best characterized as "pretentious."
Interpret that as you wish.
Regardless, I love to talk about music so talk to me about it.

For some of my projects, check out [my github](http://github.com/dpzmick) or [my Resume](http://dpzmick.com/resume/resume.pdf).
