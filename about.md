I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois interested in
programming languages, operating systems, high performance computing, and quite
a few other things.

After graduation I am planning to work for [Jump
Trading](http://jumptrading.com).

For some of my work, check out [ my github ]( http://github.com/dpzmick ) or, if
you want to look at something pretty, here are some of my [ photographs ](
