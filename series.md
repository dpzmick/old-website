### Rust Synthesizer (end of 2016, will go into 2017)
I'm attempting to create a simple synthesizer from scratch in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).
These posts are written assuming some basic systems programming knowledge, but no understanding of realtime programming or audio should be needed.
I will not explain all of the details needed to implement your own synth from scratch, but I will litter each post links to additional information.

* [Audio programming 101](/2016/12/11/audio-basics/)
    * Defines digital audio and types of audio applications
    * Discusses some of the nuances of digital audio programming
* [Garbage collection for Arc pointers](/2016/11/19/rust-arc-gc-realtime/)
    * A technique which can be used to send messages between threads

### Study groups simulation (2014)
An simulation exploring how large study groups should be.

* [Part 1](/2014/05/31/study-groups-pt-1/) - Walks through the model for the simulation
* [Part 2](/2014/07/07/study-groups-pt-2/) - Better simulation than the first post, slightly better conclusions
